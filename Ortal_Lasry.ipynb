The AI was used only in the purpose of learning and achieving the final goal of the program. I have thought of implementing a JSON file but still need more practice so i will try to implement this also. through AI i have learned how to build JSON from scratch and storing data but i got stuck because this part is still new to me.\n","\n","Thank you for taking the time to read this and hope you will enjoy prompting this program.\n","\n","Ortal Lasry (no, i haven't used AI to write this paragraph :)\n","\n","Note: The final code is at the bottom. all the other blocks were tries that didn't fully work, debugged it untill reaching the final code at the final block.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":491,"status":"ok","timestamp":1719647886206,"user":{"displayName":"Yuval Mazor","userId":"15539335787656803267"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"TaYbjK_AxBUj","outputId":"88466a1c-8925-41b1-a344-0fae44e215d3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Ingredient(name=Aloe Vera, benefits=['Soothing', 'Hydration'], recommended_percentage=5, max_percentage=10)\n","Ingredient(name=Salicylic Acid, benefits=['Acne', 'Exfoliation'], recommended_percentage=2, max_percentage=5)\n","Ingredient(name=Hyaluronic Acid, benefits=['Hydration', 'Plumping'], recommended_percentage=3, max_percentage=10)\n","Product(name=Hydrating Serum, product_type=serum, ingredients=[(Ingredient(name=Aloe Vera, benefits=['Soothing', 'Hydration'], recommended_percentage=5, max_percentage=10), -5), (Ingredient(name=Hyaluronic Acid, benefits=['Hydration', 'Plumping'], recommended_percentage=3, max_percentage=10), 3)], total_percentage=-2)\n","User(name=Alice, age=30, gender=female, skin_type=combination, skin_concerns=['acne', 'hydration'])\n"]}],"source":["from dataclasses import dataclass, field\n","\n","@dataclass\n","class Ingredient:\n","    name = \"\"\n","    benefits = []\n","    recommended_percentage = 0\n","    max_percentage = 0\n","\n","    def set_ingredient(self, name, benefits, recommended_percentage, max_percentage):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.benefits = benefits\n","        self.recommended_percentage = recommended_percentage\n","        self.max_percentage = max_percentage\n","\n","    def __repr__(self):\n","        return f\"Ingredient(name={self.name}, benefits={self.benefits}, recommended_percentage={self.recommended_percentage}, max_percentage={self.max_percentage})\"\n","\n","@dataclass\n","class Product:\n","    name = \"\"\n","    product_type = \"\"\n","    ingredients = []\n","    total_percentage = 0\n","\n","    def set_product(self, name, product_type):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.product_type = product_type\n","        self.ingredients = []\n","        self.total_percentage = 0\n","\n","    def add_ingredient(self, ingredient, percentage):\n","        if self.total_percentage + percentage <= 100:\n","            if percentage <= ingredient.max_percentage:\n","                self.ingredients.append((ingredient, percentage))\n","                self.total_percentage += percentage\n","            else:\n","                print(f\"Error: Cannot add {ingredient.name} at {percentage}%.
